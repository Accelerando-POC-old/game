Acme Engineering is prepping their biggest launch to date, a [multiplayer snake battle royale experience](https://acme-hackathon.herokuapp.com). You're tasked with taking the coding efforts of just one engineering team, and Innersourcing a fork of the source code for **all of** Acme, and soon, the **entire open source community** to learn from.

You and your Hackathon competition have early access to [The Game](https://acme-hackathon.herokuapp.com), the Tenants Of Innersourcing, and ~4 hours to get this thing ready for launch day...

This portion is just the Innersourcing fundamentals, but it is the first of four potential projects, taking this jumble of source code to a real Innersourced Repo, with GitHub Pages enabled, CI/CD automation, and even GitHub Apps all running on your own personal GitHub fork of **The Game**.

Will you decide to team up with some of your Hackathon competition and finish all four projects? Maybe you're all eyeing the **Collaborator** Awards

Take it solo and lead the charge? The **Marathoner award** is maybe what you're after.

Maybe you're really interested in just getting the highest score on The Game right now... if that's the case you might be up for bragging rights with **The Player One** award.

 .. oh, we forgot to mention, you're also staffed with the naming of this thing. Prizes for the best Game Name ðŸ˜‰
